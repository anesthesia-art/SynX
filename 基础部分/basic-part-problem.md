# Markdown basic part problem

I have written all the questions about the basic part in this markdown file

## all the .exe files are in the out directory
## All executable files have default names,because I didn't understand what your requirements were.

## Problem 1 Regarding Environmental Configuration
Configuring Git and the GitHub remote repository took a lot of time, and I still had to ask AI about some of GitHub's usage. I'm still not sure if I have done it correctly.

## Problem 2 About Programming
In terms of programming, aside from the rock-paper-scissors game which felt relatively complex, the main issue was that my learning progress didn’t keep up—I haven’t covered pointers in C yet. Other programming problems were relatively simple, but the one about counting identical elements in an array was something I had to ask AI about—I really didn’t expect that. Regarding the rock-paper-scissors game, the overall approach is quite similar to a number-guessing game I previously wrote in Python. However, there are many functions in C that I haven’t learned yet, such as random number functions and timing, so writing it wasn’t as straightforward as it was in Python.

the most important thing I learned from this problem was that I need to be more patient with my programming skills. I should be able to learn new concepts and apply them to solve problems, but I also need to be patient and not give up easily.

## About GitHub,
I still haven’t used it much, but I’m excited to learn more about it. I’m also looking forward to using it in my future projects.

## About Git
Git is an intelligent document and code manager,It can remember history, facilitating the viewing of who made changes to a document and when. It also allows for file rollbacks, multi-terminal synchronization, and collaborative coding among multiple users.Using Git, you can systematically distinguish between modified files, process files, and final results, and accidentally deleted files can also be restored.
Advantages of Git: free, secure, fast, and convenient for collaboration; 
disadvantages: high entry threshold, too many functions make it a bit complicated for me
